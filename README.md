# Evaluate-Earning-Report-Impacts
This project is a final team project in Financial Computing in NYU Tandon.

In this program, we:
1. Use liburl to retrieve historical price data for selected S & P 500 stocks and SPY from Yahoo Finance and store into memory.
2. Divide all stocks into 3 groups - 'beat', 'meet' and 'miss' - by their eps performace
3. Calculate AAR(Average Abnormal Return) and CAAR(Cumulative AAR) for each group using bootstrapping
4. Use Excel Driver to show the CAAR from all 3 groups in one graph
